What makes us unique? How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. We are particularly interested in how individuals resolve ambiguity in narratives, and how this process varies with trait- and state-level factors.
