		<font size="3">Emily is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College. She completed her Ph.D. in neuroscience at Yale, and her postdoctoral training at the National Institute of Mental Health. Before that, she received a B.A. in linguistics, also from Yale. Emily’s work is focused on individual variability in brain activity and behavior, especially as it relates to appraisal of ambiguous information under naturalistic conditions. When not science-ing, she can often be found doing something outdoors, playing guitar (poorly), or summoning the motivation to exercise.</font><br>

		<font size="3">Rekha is a postdoctoral fellow in the FINN lab. She holds a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from NIT Warangal (India) and a Master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from Maastricht University (The Netherlands). She did her doctoral work at the Visual Perception lab at Charite-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Germany) and was part of the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin. Rekha is broadly interested in learning what makes perception subjective even in the absence of explicit biases (e.g. “the dress” on Tumblr). In the FINN lab, she is excited to study how changing low-level physical properties can influence complex social percepts. Her current hobbies include discovering new hiking trails, hogging history videos on YouTube and perfecting a sourdough recipe.</font><br>

		<font size="3">Peng is a postdoc in FINN Lab. He did his B.S study in computer information system at Tianjin University (China) and then became a software engineer. Several years later, he obtained an M.S degree in computer science from Florida International University (FIU).  After one year of study in the computer science Ph.D. program at FIU, he joined the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida. He completed his doctoral training in interdisciplinary areas focusing on machine learning, computational cognitive neuroscience, and medical image analysis in 2021. He has a broad interest in understanding the brain, revealing the neural mechanisms underlying both normal brain functions and pathologies in mental disorders, and gaining inspiration to build a better model of the brain and advanced AI. Out of research, he loves reading, music, coding, hiking, natural landscape, arts, soccer, etc.</font><br>

Before Dartmouth, she got her Bachelor’s degree from UChicago in 2018 and then worked as a research assistant at Stanford’s Laboratory for Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience. Broadly, Clara is interested in how we integrate information with our existent knowledge, and how neural patterns are formed, modified and updated with experiences. Specifically, she is interested in how certain experiences and traits drive differences in behavior and neural activity across individuals and is excited to use naturalistic stimuli to investigate these questions. Outside the lab, Clara can be found painting, reading, hiking, or doing science education outreach.</font><br>

After graduating, he worked as a research assistant for UCLA Center of Behavioral and Addiction Medicine, a cheesemonger, and, penultimately, a lab manager for the Robertson Lab. Broadly, Tommy is interested in how differences in brain and behavior drive individual experience under ambiguous circumstances. Specifically, how do state- and trait-based factors, across neurotypical and neurodiverse populations, influence the processing of information and resulting behavior. Outside of lab, Tommy enjoys hiking, playing music, cooking, and petting animals that cross his path.</font><br>
